# Final Project for Graphics
>Name: Bryan Lai <br />
Class Period: 10

Throughout this project, I would like to make changes to some of the pre-existing features of MDL. Once this is completed, I hope to add new features as well to the engine. Here is a tentative list.

# Current Version:
* Cone shape was added!
* Mesh for objects has been added. (e.g. mesh skyscraper) where skyscraper.obj exists in obj/


# Tentative Plan (Not all features were added.)

# Pre-existing Features:
* set: Assigning a value to a knob.
* tween: Producing an animation by going through knob lists.
* light: Add a light to the symbol table. In addition, when calculating diffuse and specular: loop through all the lights.

# New Features:
* New primitive shapes to be added. (Cones, Wedges, Octahedrons, etc.)
* Using vary to move lights.
* Change the behavior of vary by adding a parameter to change how it calculates the change over time. e.g. Linear, Exponential, Logarithmic, Arbitrary equation, etc.
